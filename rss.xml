            <description><![CDATA[<p>Rebecca is a life saver! Although I considered working with a doula, I did not arrange for one nor did I take any labor classes. To my surprise, I went into labor five weeks early and an angel showed up on her own time on one of the coldest Sundayâ€™s of the year to guide me through one of the most important moments in my life. Rebecca was extremely empathetic and supportive during the whole experience. She showed up when I needed her the most. Her communication skills were superb and her calm energy helped me to stay focused and relaxed during a time when I was naturally a bit shocked and nervous given the unexpected nature of my early labor. I cannot thank her enough for her service and warmth. My husband and I will never consider having a baby without a doula in the future, thanks to Rebecca.</p>]]></description>
