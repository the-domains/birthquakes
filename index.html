<p>I am fortunate to have had Rebecca as my doula. She was an incredible source of support throughout my pregnancy. Her unwavering belief in me and my ability to have the birth I so wanted, as well as her knowledge and passion for natural birth, helped build my confidence and brought me so much peace at key times. Her approach is a very wise and spiritual one, which was a great fit for me. She really listened to the fact that one of my main goals was to not feel as dependent on my doula during labor & delivery as I did with my first baby. I wanted to really draw on the strength I know I have within and trust my body to show me the way. And that is exactly what happened. Rebecca & I communicated through my early and middle stages of labor via phone and she was instrumental in helping me find positions that would help. When she arrived at my home, I was deep in the late stage of labor. Rebecca was very helpful in reminding me of things like rocking through my contractions and "staying on top of the wave," and then she just let me do what I needed...just as I had told her many times that I so wanted to do. Having her present and knowing that if I needed more from her I would have it, brought me much comfort. During delivery, Rebecca took numerous pictures so that I could have record of those truly incredible first moments of, and following, the birth of my son. Rebecca was great about noticing what I needed right after the birth. For example, it seemed like just moments after one of the midwives asked when I had eaten last, and then everyone realized it had been the day prior, Rebecca appeared with a plate of scrambled eggs for me. She then remained available for an hour or two after and made sure I was all set with what I needed before she headed out. Rebecca checked in with me regularly after the birth and came for a home visit soon after. She was careful to make sure the day and time worked fine for us and that she wasn't intruding during those very hectic early postpartum days. When she came, she was focused on me and asked questions important to assessing if there were any additional needs. All in all, Rebecca was exactly the doula that I needed. She truly is a beautiful soul doing incredibly life changing work.---Silvana Casas-Perez, LCSW </p><p>My experience with Rebecca was fantastic. She is a very thoughtful doula. I had moved at the end of my pregnancy and felt very alone in a new place. Rebecca's presence helped me feel more at home and supported. I appreciated how often she checked in with me and all the encouragement she offered me during my pregnancy. It often felt like she had just the right thing say! She also helped me generally feel more prepared than I would have otherwise by helping me with my birth plan, giving me exercises to do, and items to have ready at home. After the birth she noticed all my little needs (like how I needed Chapstick or that no one was taking pictures of my brand new baby) and helped meet them. Thank you Rebecca!---Sarah Gershon 2/2/2016</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="35"><!-- react-empty: 36 --></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title  text-align-left  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="37"><div class="Component p-1  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="38"><div class="Group Group--graphical max-w-768px p-1 m-h-a" data-reactid="39"><span class="" data-reactid="40"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="41"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="42"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c7b6cf2ea9c5ebedc0b66b928e6c5e87/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F4f847c7633a8c96baf59b74c21d2c80f25756665.jpg&amp;width=960" style="object-position:44.479166666666664% 48.854166666666664%;" data-reactid="43"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c7b6cf2ea9c5ebedc0b66b928e6c5e87/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F4f847c7633a8c96baf59b74c21d2c80f25756665.jpg&amp;width=960" style="object-position:44.479166666666664% 48.854166666666664%;" data-reactid="44"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/68c3ec98440ded8716d81f7c26a586f3/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F4f847c7633a8c96baf59b74c21d2c80f25756665.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:44.479166666666664% 48.854166666666664%;" data-reactid="45"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d5840c90eebeea30a2f61cc9104e6504/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F4f847c7633a8c96baf59b74c21d2c80f25756665.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:44.479166666666664% 48.854166666666664%;" data-reactid="46"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="960" data-height="960" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c7b6cf2ea9c5ebedc0b66b928e6c5e87/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F4f847c7633a8c96baf59b74c21d2c80f25756665.jpg&amp;width=960" style="object-position:44.479166666666664% 48.854166666666664%;" data-reactid="47"/></picture></div></span><!-- react-empty: 48 --><!-- react-empty: 49 --><!-- react-empty: 50 --></div></div></section></div><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="51"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="52"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="53"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="54"><span data-reactid="55"><!-- react-empty: 56 --><h2 data-reactid="57"><a data-reactid="58">Birthquakes</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="60"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="61"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="62"></div></section></div></div>

Her approach is a very wise and spiritual one, which was a great fit for me.

Rebecca & I communicated through my early and middle stages of labor via phone and she was instrumental in helping me find positions that would help. When she arrived at my home, I was deep in the late stage of labor.
