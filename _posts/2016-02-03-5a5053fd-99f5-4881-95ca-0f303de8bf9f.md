I am fortunate to have had Rebecca as my doula. She was an incredible source of support throughout my pregnancy. Her unwavering belief in me and my ability to have the birth I so wanted, as well as her knowledge and passion for natural birth, helped build my confidence and brought me so much peace at key times. Her approach is a very wise and spiritual one, which was a great fit for me. She really listened to the fact that one of my main goals was to not feel as dependent on my doula during labor & delivery as I did with my first baby. I wanted to really draw on the strength I know I have within and trust my body to show me the way. And that is exactly what happened. Rebecca & I communicated through my early and middle stages of labor via phone and she was instrumental in helping me find positions that would help. When she arrived at my home, I was deep in the late stage of labor. Rebecca was very helpful in reminding me of things like rocking through my contractions and "staying on top of the wave," and then she just let me do what I needed...just as I had told her many times that I so wanted to do. Having her present and knowing that if I needed more from her I would have it, brought me much comfort. During delivery, Rebecca took numerous pictures so that I could have record of those truly incredible first moments of, and following, the birth of my son. Rebecca was great about noticing what I needed right after the birth. For example, it seemed like just moments after one of the midwives asked when I had eaten last, and then everyone realized it had been the day prior, Rebecca appeared with a plate of scrambled eggs for me. She then remained available for an hour or two after and made sure I was all set with what I needed before she headed out. Rebecca checked in with me regularly after the birth and came for a home visit soon after. She was careful to make sure the day and time worked fine for us and that she wasn't intruding during those very hectic early postpartum days. When she came, she was focused on me and asked questions important to assessing if there were any additional needs. All in all, Rebecca was exactly the doula that I needed. She truly is a beautiful soul doing incredibly life changing work.

My experience with Rebecca was fantastic. She is a very thoughtful doula. I had moved at the end of my pregnancy and felt very alone in a new place. Rebecca's presence helped me feel more at home and supported. I appreciated how often she checked in with me and all the encouragement she offered me during my pregnancy. It often felt like she had just the right thing say! She also helped me generally feel more prepared than I would have otherwise by helping me with my birth plan, giving me exercises to do, and items to have ready at home. After the birth she noticed all my little needs (like how I needed Chapstick or that no one was taking pictures of my brand new baby) and helped meet them. Thank you Rebecca!

Rebecca is a life saver! Although I considered working with a doula, I did not arrange for one nor did I take any labor classes. To my surprise, I went into labor five weeks early and an angel showed up on her own time on one of the coldest Sundays of the year to guide me through one of the most important moments in my life. Rebecca was extremely empathetic and supportive during the whole experience. She showed up when I needed her the most. Her communication skills were superb and her calm energy helped me to stay focused and relaxed during a time when I was naturally a bit shocked and nervous given the unexpected nature of my early labor. I cannot thank her enough for her service and warmth. My husband and I will never consider having a baby without a doula in the future, thanks to Rebecca.

Rebecca served as our birth and post-partum doula for the birth of our first daughter, Mahalia, in March, 2015\. She was amazing and helped tremendously with so many aspects of the birth and post-partum period. On the day of Mahalia's birth, she brought an amazing energy into the hospital room. She helped me with pain-coping and visualization techniques that allowed me to withstand the pain of labor (which was induced with pitocin) without the use of pain medicines. She also gave my husband a much-needed break after 12 hours of supporting my labor overnight. She even took some amazing photos during labor that our family will always treasure. During the post-partum period she visited me once a week and helped with housework, answered breastfeeding questions and provided much-needed emotional support! Rebecca is an incredibly warm, giving, thoughtful and nurturing person and my husband and I are so thankful that she was a part of Mahalia's birth. We will always have a special bond with her and we highly recommend her doula services.

Since I wanted to give birth to my first child without any shots, me and my husband were considering to get a doula, but then decided that we could handle it on our own and never found one in advance. I was induced on September 11, and early in the morning on September 12 when I was already in mild pain, my midwife asked if we wanted her to see if there was any doula available that day, and we agreed. For a while I could handle the pain by bouncing on the fit ball, marching, walking, dancing, but then I reached the point when I was laying on the bed in pain, exhausted, and begging for epidural shot, because I thought that nothing else can help, and my husband had no idea how to help me either. Right at that time came Rebecca, and got me through the rest of the labor without any shots. She made me believe in myself, convinced me that I can handle it on my own, then started trying different positions for me (that apparently were much better than just laying on the back), was squeezing my hips, telling my husband what he could do as well, told me to visualize certain things, and Rebecca was the one who noticed that I was ready for pushing and called for a midwife. She was so sweet and caring, we are so happy that Rebecca was available on that day. Before she came, me and my husband felt so lonely, because midwifes would just stop by, check how dilated I was and leave, there is no one in the hospital who can be there for the whole time with you helping.

I'm so glad that I got to experience in full this natural process of labor, It was truly a beautiful day, and Rebecca is a big part of it. My husband and I love to tell our friends about how our son was born and how Rebecca helped us. We strongly recommend Rebecca as your knowledgeable and loving doula! I don't know when we are going to have a second kid, but hopefully we will be still in the same area and Rebecca can be my birthing coach again.
